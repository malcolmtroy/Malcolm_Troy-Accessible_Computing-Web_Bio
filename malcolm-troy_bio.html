        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Howdy! My name is <strong>Malcolm Troy</strong>, and I am a junior in the Computer Science program with minors in Business and Technical Sales at
            <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html">Texas A&M University</a>. I am from San Antonio, Texas, and come from a family of five with
            an older brother and younger sister. I aspire to be a solutions engineer for software oriented issues as I enjoy helping and interacting
            with other people.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2>Accessibility Interest</h2>
            
            <h3>My Personal Experience</h3>
                <p>I am a <strong>Type 1 Diabetic</strong> and that has greatly impacted my life as I have to deal with issues all of the time revolving around my diet,
                medical devices, and more. I benefit a great deal from specific designs such as nutrition facts on packiging or menus offering low carb and
                no sugar options. It is such a blessing to live in this modern age with the advancements we have made and I love learning about how to be
                more inclusive towards those who deal with disabilities as well.</p>

            <h3>Interest Beyond</h3>
                <p>As someone whose major revolves around computers and software, the intersection between accessibility and technology has obviously caught my
                eye. Features such as high contrast interfaces, text-to-speech, screen reader compatibility, captions, voice navigation, and customizable UI
                settings show how thoughtful programming can make digital spaces more inclusive. I look forward to researching human-computer interaction in
                this class and how to improve user experience and incorporate universal design.</p>
